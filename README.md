## About
When I tried to use apps of this kind I always ended up deleting them. They are overheaded with functionality and you need to manually provide them with some data (and why are they always pink?). But I am a very lazy person and only need them to store history. Thus I decided to create an app that would itself ask me through notifications about dates and automatically write it to history. Nothing more, nothing less: only notifications, only hardcore.
